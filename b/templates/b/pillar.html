                    <h4 align="justify" >Here are the 12 stones, after the order of Joshua 4:1-8, 20-24.</h4>
                    <p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">God commissioned us with a Word of Faith ministry to our generation. Remember Paul said, "...if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?" (1 Cor 14:8) By the help of the Holy Ghost, our visioner has classified the Word of Faith God has committed into his hands into the specific areas of emphasis, in direct response to Isaiah 40:6, "The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?" <br/>
					</p>
					<h4 id="numero1" class="so-awesome">THE WORD (John 1:1-12; Heb. 1:3)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high." - Heb. 1:3</p>
					<h4 id="numero2">THE HOLY SPIRIT (Acts 1:1-8; Isaiah 10:27)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing." - Isaiah 10:27</p>
					<h4 id="numero3">THE SUPERNATURAL (Ps. 82:5-7; John 3:8)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit." - John 3:8</p>
					<h4 id="numero4">FAITH (1 John 5:4; Eph. 6:16)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith." - 1 John 5:4</p>
					<h4 id="numero5">SUCCESS (Joshua 1:8-10)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success." - Joshua 1: 8</p>
					<h4 id="numero6">PRAISE (2 Chro. 20:20-22; Ps. 67:1-7; 149:1-9)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah: and they were smitten." - 2 Chro. 20:22</p>
					<h4 id="numero7">CONSECRATION (Hebrews12:14; 2Tim. 2:19)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his. And let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. " - 2 Tim. 2:19</p>
					<h4 id="numero8">PRAYER (1 John 5:14)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us." - 1 John 5:14</p>
					<h4 id="numero9">HEALING (Isaiah 53:3-4; Jer. 8:22; Matt. 8:17)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses." - Matt. 8:17</p>
					<h4 id="numero10">WISDOM (Prov. 24:3-4, Isaiah 33:6)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure." - Isaiah 33:6</p>
					<h4 id="numero11">VISION (Prov. 29:18, Jer. 29:11)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he." - Prov. 29:18</p>
					<h4 id="numero12">PROSPERITY (3 John 2; Ps. 35:27; Zech. 1:17)</h4>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth." - 3 John 2</p>
					<p align="justify" class="fontsforweb_fontid_9785">The Presiding Bishop has named these 12 areas of emphasis as the 12 Pillars of our Commission. We have stood firm upon these twelve stones and they have resulted in breakthroughs - both for the ministry and all that are partakers of the same grace with us. We have crossed Jordan into power, bearing the ark of liberation and have experienced amazing testimonies ever since this commission was handed down in May 02, 1981. </p>
